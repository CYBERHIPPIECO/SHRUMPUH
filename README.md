Chantarelle

Prized for a fruity aroma, chanterelles range from yellow, orange, and brown to pale white or black. The funnel-shaped caps have wrinkles instead of gills on the underside, which should be washed quickly but carefully before using.

Button Mushroom

The most common type, white mushrooms range in size from tiny—called button, which are harvested when young and have the mildest flavor—to jumbo, which can be stuffed and baked. Creamy white to pale tan, they have a firm texture and a delicate flavour.

Oyster Mushroom

Velvety and trumpet-shaped, oyster mushrooms have delicate brown, gray, or reddish caps on gray-white stems. They have a peppery flavor that becomes very mild when cooked. Young, small specimens are considered the best.

Portobello Mushroom

Up to 6 inches across, portobellos have a big, steak-like taste and texture; in fact, the huge, umbrella-like caps are often eaten as vegetarian burger substitutes. Remove the woody stems before eating.

Shiitake Mushroom

With meaty tan to dark-brown umbrella-like caps, shiitakes have a distinctively smoky flavor and taste best when cooked. Available fresh or dried, they work well in stir-fries as the flavor doesn’t fade next to ginger and garlic. Although the stems are too tough to eat and should be removed from the heads before cooking, you can use them to flavor stocks and sauces before discarding.

Cremini Mushroom

Similar to white mushrooms but with a firmer texture and deeper flavor, creminis are actually immature portobellos. The button-like caps range from pale tan to rich brown. The stems are edible.

Psylocybin Mushroom

Psilocybin mushrooms, also known as psychedelic mushrooms, are mushrooms that contain thepsychedelic drugs psilocybin and psilocin. Common colloquial terms include magic mushrooms andshrooms.[1] Biological genera containing psilocybin mushrooms include Copelandia, Galerina, Gymnopilus,Inocybe, Mycena, Panaeolus, Pholiotina, Pluteus, andPsilocybe. About 40 species are found in the genusPsilocybe. Psilocybe cubensis is the most common psilocybin mushroom in subtropical areas and the black market.

Psilocybin mushrooms have likely been used sinceprehistoric times and may have been depicted in rock art. Many cultures have used these mushrooms in religious rites. In modern Western society, they are usedrecreationally for their psychedelic effects.
